# Customer Support Chatbot with LangChain (RAG-based)

This project showcases a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It allows users or customer service agents to interact conversationally with internal support documentation (e.g., refund policies) to quickly surface relevant answers.

Inspired by a real world usecase I worked on, this version uses synthetic documents to demonstrate architecture and capabilities while preserving confidentiality.

## Features

** Document aware Q&A** over internal policies
** RAG pipeline ** using LangChain, OpenAIEmbeddings, FAISS 
** COnversational Interface ** using Streamlit
Easy API managemnet with .env support
Extendable to use multiple pdfs, feedback data or databases
